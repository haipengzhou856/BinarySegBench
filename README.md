# SegBench: A simple toolbox for Implementing Binary Segmentation

## Introduction

This project aims to build up a benchmark for **fair and solid comparisons** with the *state-of-the-art* segmentation methods. Motivated by [sssegmentation](https://github.com/SegmentationBLWX/sssegmentation), we hope to excel at the **Binary Segmentation** which is prevailing in minority tasks but also matters, e.g., **Shadow Detection, Camouflage Object Detection, Saliency Object Detection, and most of Medical Image Segmentation**. 

In a sum, we:

* Present read and deployment-friendly codes for Training/Testing
* Present a wide range of cutting-edge methods comparisons with several datasets
* Provide full experiment details including the logs, ~~tensorboard~~Ôºàtoo large, forget it **üòÖ**Ôºâ, and ckpt

## Environments

The codes mainly rely on the **[HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/)ü§ó**, including the Distributed Training (**[Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index)**), Model Architecture (**[Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index)**).

My stable version for these packages are:

```
pip install accelerate==0.20.3
pip install transformers
```

Pytorch is suggested to update with version `1.12.1` or higher. I will try more efficient implementations with [Flash Attention](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch2-2/) , [Torch Compile](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torch_compile_tutorial.html) and etc. in the future.
